# Lichtumgebungen
Bachelor Thesis: We analyzed learning efficiency under different light environments. This repository provides the application that we used to measure learning efficiency.

### Run the experiment without light
To run the experiment without light navigate in terminal to the folder. Then use command line: ```python3 Experiment_ohne_Licht.py```. If there are requirements missing, install the module with ```pip install <module>``` or ```conda install <module>```. The folder images needs to be in the same folder as the application.

### Run the experiment with light
To run the experiment with light the Philips Hue Bridge and Philip Smart lights are needed. Connect the Philips Hue Bridge and the Philips smart lights via ethernet cable to your computer. Set up an internal network which connects the computer to the Philips Hue Bridge and the Philips Smart lights.
Navigate in the terminal to the folder. Then use command line: ```python3 Experiment_mit_Licht.py```. If there are requirements missing, install the module with ```pip install <module>``` or ```conda install <module>```. The folder images needs to be in the same folder as the application.
